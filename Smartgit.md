# Simple guide to using smartgit

This is a quick and dirty guide to making an account, installing the program, and getting it connected to the git server, all without touching the commandline.

## 1: Making an account.

For now, I decided to use gitlab.com because it has free private projects, compared to github's paid private option.

Make an account at https://gitlab.com/ and confirm with the link sent to your email. Once you're done, navigate to your settings and select the account option shown here

Keep it up, you'll need to private token soon.

## 2: Download and set up Smart Git
install http://www.syntevo.com/. During the setup, you will see this screen

Select the option in red.

Select the default options as you wish, especially the Username and Email options. Once you get to this screen

Again, select the red option (gitlab)

Here you will get a screen asking you for your private token, all you have to do is open the page I told you to keep open and paste your private token!

Once it's done, you have to connect it to your repo.

## 3: Connecting to repo

On the welcome screen, select to clone a repo as shown here

At the next screen, select this dropdown menu

And then select the project you have been invited to

Create a new folder for this project, and select it when it asks you to **REMEMBER** anything added to this folder could be seen by every other member of the project.

## Optional

## 4: Using the program

Once it is connected and the repo is synced, you are free to open it in rpgmaker 2003 and begin working to your heart's content. Once you've made meaningful progress, it's time to push it back to the repo!

If you look at the file screen in the middle, you will see a list of all the files you have modified and/or added like this

This is good! Next step is to click on the commit option up here

On the next screen, make sure all the files are checked and hit the commit & push option

Wait for it to finish uploading by watching the output box here and then you're done!
